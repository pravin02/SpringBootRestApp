This is an SpringBootRestAPIApp as a starter for rest API using spring boot framework and JPA(Java Persistant API)


Currently I have implemented only following APIs,
1) countries 	- http://localhost:8080/api/countries
2) states	- http://localhost:8080/api/states/1
3) cities	- http://localhost:8080/api/cities/1

1) To run this project you can clone it or download backup and configure in eclipse editor or Intellij Editor.
2) Install mysql
3) Create database restapp
4) And run project using maven-build

In future I have planning for to work this repo with https://github.com/pravin02/Admin-lte-starter-template this one.
